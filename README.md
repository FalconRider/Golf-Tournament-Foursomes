A Leap Experiment. GOLF TOURNAMENT FOURSOMES 

A Satellite Constellation Model Derivation.  
It's time again for the annual golf tournament at a 12 person start up.

You want evenly skilled teams so that everyone has a chance at the team prizes.

After all it's supposed to be a company wide  team building day. 
So you make inquiries about golf skills and ask "What percentage of the time do you make par?"  No one lies. 

Each player gets a code number 0 to 11 (12 players) and you set the thingie in the json to 3 to get 3 teams and add the data.  
In the Leap IDE you run a number of times to get possible foursomes that are even skilled . 
Note that there's a minimum skill threshold in the formula left at .4 but  could be changed in the runner program.
I left labels as in the original "satellite" version here.  I wrote a py generator for the json pairs and its included. 
This way you could try 1200 golfers although the documentations says the 39 pairs example would be a noticeable slowdown.  
This is an experiment.

Problem: pairs generator last comma. deleted manually.
Original small.json inclusedjust so could see I tried with my pairs.
